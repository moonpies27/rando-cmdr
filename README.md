A simple utility for quickly assigning random commanders to players in a game of Magic: the Gathering.

## Why?
My friends and I love to play the MtG game format Commander (https://mtgcommander.net)

We decided that it would be fun to randomly assign Commanders to each player, have them build that deck, then present the deck to another player to play that week. This tool is simply and easy and efficient way to automate the assignment of Commanders to each player as well as the recipient of that player's deck.
